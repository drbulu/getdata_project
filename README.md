## Context:
 Wearable devices + link
 Dataset: brief overview
 
## Aim of project:
The aim of the current excercise is to generate a script, called run_analysis.R, that will use the information in the source dataset to construct a tidy data subset. This tidy set consists only of the variables that represent the mean and standard deviation (std) of other variables contained within the source dataset.

## Implementation instructions
The project is comprised of a number of components:
1) The run_analysis.R script: This is run in the R environment to process the source data and produce the tidy data.

Note: it is important to run the script in a working directory that contains the script
 what you must do
 how the computer will respond if you don't do this
 how you must fix this!

2) The code book: This is supplied as the CodeBook.md file, which provides
    a) An outline of the steps used by the run_analysis.R script to produce the data 
    b) The rationale behind those steps.
3) The tidy data: This is provided as an example of the expected output of run_analysis.R.
